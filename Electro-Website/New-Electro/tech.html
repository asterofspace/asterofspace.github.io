	<h3> Our products are made up of only the best materials possible</h3>
<br>
	
	<p>We use Mu-metal and hard-coated polycarbonate in all of our basic models. The Mu-metal is used inside of the charger to buffer the electromagnetic field. This allows you to have your charger anywhere, even next to your phone without messing with the electronics of your device. The hard-coated polycarbonate is the outside that you will actually see. It is an extremely strong plastic that we use to make a long lasting product that is light and available in many colors. We also make full metal models for those who don't want a colorful or plastic charger. This will still have the Mu-metal interior for electromagnetic shielding but made of liquid metal on the outside to give it a clean look. The liquid metal models come in colors similar to the Iphone 5s gold, silver and space grey because it is made of the same material. We also have available to order a solid gold version for those of you who live the high life and would like to be able to charge in style. This model of course has the Mu-metal protection and 
is only available to pre order due to the expensiveness of the materials it is made out of. </p>

	<h3> Similarity with an Interesting Twist</h3>
	<h4>  An Electro charger is just like any other portable charger </h4>
	
	<p>  It's a battery that you can use to charge your phone or any other device that charges through a usb plug. With any other charger though, you have to plug it into a wall and charge it before it can be used, with Electro chargers you never have to charge it. Electro chargers have a small electromagnetic generator in them to keep the battery charged at all times.An electromagnetic generator works just like a windmill or a hydroelectric generator. They have blades that are pushed by an outside force to move them causing the motor to produce energy. With an electromagnetic generator the outside force is a stationary magnet. This magnet has the same pole facing the generator that repels the other magnets attached to the blades causing the blade to rotate, producing energy from the motor that the blade is attached too.This gives you unlimited power any where.

	<h3>As Proud Producers of a Quality Product who Believe in Unlimited Energy,</h3>
	
	
	<p> We also believe in a product that will last infinitely as well. As we can obviously not provide a product that lasts forever, as nothing does,  we do however want to guarantee our customers a product that will last. Should your Electro Charge Pack have any flaws in it whether it be external or internal, we will gladly replace your unit with a brand new one. Should your unit have any internal problems within a year you can send it in to our nearest location and have one of our certified technicians repair your unit. After this time period if you wish to purchase another charger for any reason you can send in your used Electro Charge Pack and receive a discount on your new unit.
